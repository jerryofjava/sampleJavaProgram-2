# sampleJavaProgram-2
A sample Java program that uses the System.in to take an array of numbers, and to compute for the absolute difference between the number of even and odd numbers in the array

Example Input:

12 14 16 9 7

Output:

1

Because, 12, 14, and 16 are even, so there are 3 even numbers in the array; 9 ,and 7 are odd numbers, so there 2 odd numbers in the array. So, 3-2=1

Where:

12 14 16 9 7 <--Array of numbers (input)

1 <--Absolute difference between the number of even and odd number entries in the array (output)
